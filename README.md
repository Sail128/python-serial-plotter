# python-serial-plotter
A small aplication to plot values recieved over a serial connection

# requirements

* dearpygui
* pyserial

Honestly this is a small application to plot multiple different values at the same time. In principle it should handle upto 30 values in parallel. 
This is not perfect and will not be perfect.
If I have time I will most likely rewrite this.
